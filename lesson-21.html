                    INTRODUCTION: Tomiwa was registered for some external exams and he discovered <br>
                    recently that his parents went to the extent of selling some of their property to register for <br>
                    the exam. This got him so worried because of the stories he had heard over time of people <br>
                    failing these exams and having to do them two to three times before making it. Now he is <br>
                    not just writing one but about three of these exams and he just does not know what to do <br>
                    to make sure he does not fail any of them. <br><br>
                    He got to Church on Sunday and his teacher was teaching in Sunday School about the <br>
                    power of prayer - that if only we believe, God is able to answer our prayers. He held on to <br>
                    this point and decided that apart from ensuring he didn't miss any of his tutorial classes, <br>
                    he would make it a point of duty to pray about these exams daily. As he prayed, he started <br>
                    finding favour with his teachers, who took a special interest in him and gave him more <br>
                    attention. He started remembering and understanding all that he was taught and when he <br>
                    wrote the exams, he passed them all with distinctions. He was so happy that he testified in <br>
                    Church for the first time; his dance during the praise and worship period was special and <br>
                    he called each of his teachers to thank them specially, after which he sent them a small gift <br>
                    each, given by his parents. <br><br>
                    Giving of thanks is an attitude that shows that we really value all that God has done for us.<br>
                    It must therefore become a culture for us to always appreciate God by giving, in form of<br>
                    money as well as dedicating your time and energy to the work of God.

                            Thanksgiving is a celebration in acknowledgment of divine favour from God-Ps. 107:1. <br>
                            Prayer is the words a person says when they speak to God. One of the ways our <br>
                            appreciation to what God has done can be expressed is through prayers-Phil. 4:6. <br><br><br>
                            Sacrificial Giving: Sacrificial giving is giving that goes beyond our means for the love of <br>
                            another, and unto the Lord! Sacrificial giving entails: <br><br>
