                    even her ability to make friends, as she was always in and out of the hospital. One day <br>
                    while on the hospital bed, a group of teenagers who came on hospital Visitation <br>
                    introduced her to Christ and His healing power. She gave her life to Christ and that day <br>
                    the journey to healing from the disease began, such that by the end of that month, she had <br>
                    stopped taking all forms of medication. <br><br><br>
                    She was so happy that she decided to show her gratitude by attending the teenage <br>
                    witnesses' Church, the address of which she found behind the tract she had been given in <br>
                    the hospital on that fateful day. She ensured that she testified during the service of what <br>
                    the Lord had done. She joined the teenage evangelism team to start sharing with other <br>
                    teenagers the testimony that led her to Christ.
